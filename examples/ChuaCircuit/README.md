This folder contains [sim-and-plot.py](sim-and-plot.py), which generates a
Dymola script to simulate Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.ChuaCircuit from
the [Modelica Standard Library] with various parameter settings and plots the
results.  The results are generated here, but only the \*.mat files are included
in the distribution.

The examples in
[modelicares.exps.write_script](http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/exps.html#modelicares.exps.write_script)() also generate Dymola scripts here.
