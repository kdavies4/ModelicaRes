`ModelicaRes`_ is a free, open-source tool to manage `Modelica`_ simulations,
interpret results, and create publishable figures. It is currently possible to

-  Auto-generate simulation scripts,
-  Browse data,
-  Perform custom calculations, and
-  Produce various plots and diagrams.

The figures are generated via `matplotlib`_, which offers a rich set of plotting
routines.  `ModelicaRes`_ includes convenient functions to automatically
pre-format and label some figures, like xy plots, Bode and Nyquist plots, and
Sankey diagrams.  `ModelicaRes`_ can be scripted or run from a `Python`_
interpreter with math and matrix functions from `NumPy`_.

For more information, please see the `main project site`_ or the doc folder of
the package for the full documentation and many examples.  The  development site
is https://github.com/kdavies4/modelicares.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An installable copy of this package can be downloaded from the `main project
site`_ or the `PyPI page`_.  After extracting the package, run the set up script
(*setup.py*) from the base folder.  On Windows, use the following command::

    python setup.py install

On Linux, use::

    sudo python setup.py install

The *matplotlibrc* file in the *bin* folder has some recommended revisions to
`matplotlib`_'s defaults.  To use it, move or copy the file to the working
directory or `matplotlib`_'s configuration directory.  See
http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
